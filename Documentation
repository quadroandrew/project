## FLASK API DOCUMENTATION: ##
##############################

Upon running the flask_api_routes.py or app.py script and connecting to 127.0.0.0:5000/,
The user will be greeted with a simple "Enter sentence" and an input textbox.

The FLASK API receives the text from the textbox and sends it to the system for processing.
After processing, the text is returned to the HTML form, where the user can submit another sentence.
All word processing happens inside the code. The FLASK API only sends text out as a string
    and receives text back in the form of a string.

INPUT:
And now for something completely different

OUTPUT:
The sentence:
And now for something completely different

and:
From Middle English and, an, from Old English and, ond, end, from Proto-Germanic *andi, *anþi, from Proto-Indo-European *h₂énti (“facing opposite, near, in front of, before”). Cognate with Scots an (“and”), North Frisian en (“and”), West Frisian en, in (“and”), Low German un (“and”), Dutch en (“and”), German und (“and”), Danish end (“but”), Swedish än (“yet, but”), Icelandic enn (“still, yet”), Albanian edhe (“and”) (dialectal ênde, ênne), ende (“still, yet, therefore”), Latin ante (“opposite, in front of”), and Ancient Greek ἀντί (antí, “opposite, facing”).

now:
From Middle English now, nou, nu, from Old English nū, from Proto-West Germanic *nū, from Proto-Germanic *nu, from Proto-Indo-European *nū (“now”).

for:
From Middle English for, from Old English for (“for, because of”), from Proto-Germanic *furi (“for”), from Proto-Indo-European *preh₂-.

something:
From Middle English somþyng, some-thing, som thing, sum thinge, sum þinge, from Old English sum þing (literally “some thing”), equivalent to some +‎ thing. Compare Old English āwiht (“something”, literally “some thing, any thing”), Swedish någonting (“something”, literally “some thing, any thing”).

## TO ACCESS THE API: ##
########################

The system can be accessed using Postman.
A GET request at http://127.0.0.1:5000 will return the starting page HTML form.
A POST request at http://127.0.0.1:5000 needs to have a BODY variable of name "text"
    with a specific system of words in order to receive a processed result.
- In example:
    KEY:        VALUE:
    text        I+see+it
The words need to be spaced with + in order to be parsed correctly.
